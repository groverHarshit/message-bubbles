## Usage
Using this css/js library is incredibly simple! 
Here is an example of a little chat:
```html
<ul class="rounded-messages messages-width-large">
  <li>Hey, how are you?</li>
  <li class="right-msg">Hey! Long time, I'm doing well. How about yourself?</li>
  <li class="time"><strong>Today</strong> 10:37am</li>
  <li>Yeah, it's been a long time, and I'm glad to hear you're doing well. Life's crazy, but in a good way, for me!</li>
</ul>
```
